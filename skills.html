        <h2>Customer Service Representative and Technical Support Representative</h2>
        <p>I have been in the industry for  almost 5 years and experienced different types of service in this line of work. I been a general customer service which provides assistance for information. I also handled billing that covers all the accounts of customers in terms of payment. I experience being a proctor as well and handled examinees from colleges thru online. For my technical experience I worked as a technical support representative for a domain server which is AOL. We handled troubleshooting of the domain in terms of failure in sending, missing emails and retrieval of accounts. It also has a mix service which includes sales as we offer different programs that would help our customers computer. I learned different skills in this kind of work and applied it in my daily activities in terms of communicating with others, getting along with different people and patience. I hope that this skills can lead me in the programming world and I am working on my programming skills present to the years to come.</p>
